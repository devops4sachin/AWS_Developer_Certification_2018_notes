#### 1_DynamoDB Overview :

	- DynamoDB Key Features:  
		• Fully managed NoSQL database: 
			• AWS scales compute resources for you 
			• Mange data, not software/hardware 
			• Built-in monitoring 
			• Schemaless, key-value store 
		• Consistent and fast performance: 
			• Data stored on fast SSDs 
			• Control throughput with read/write capacity 
			• Replicated across multiple AWS avilability zones 
			• DynamoDB Global Tables allow for replication across AWS regions 
		• Easy to setup and communicate with: 
			• AWS Console or APIs 
			• CLI and SDKs 
			• Easily integrates with other AWS services 
			• DynamoDB Streams - Allows for other services to take action based on changes to DynamoDB items 
		• Optional encryption at rest 
		• Popular use cases include: 
			• IOT (storing meta data) 
			• Gaming (storing session information, leaderboards) 
			• Mobile (Storing user profiles, personalization) 
			
	- DynamoDB Pricing*:
		- Core Pricing Components 
			• Provisioned Throughput for Writes: 
				• Monthly rate per Write Capcity Unit (WCU)** 
			• Provisioned Throughput for Reads: 
				• Monthly rate per Read Capacity Unit (RCU)** 
			• Indexed data storage: 
				• Hourly rate per gigabyte of table data 
		
		- Other Pricing Factors 
			• Reserved capacity: 
				• Commit to paying for minimum number of RCUs and WCUs for reduced cost 
			• DynamoDB Auto Scaling: 
				• Free - you pay for the scaled read and write capacity 
			• Global Tables - Replicated Write Capacity Units (rWCUs): 
				• Used for global replica tables when setting write capacity manually 
			• On-Demand Backup - pay per GB-month stored) 
			• On-Demand Restore - pay per GB restored) 
			• DynamoDB Accellerator (DAX) - pay for the instances used per hour 
			• DynamoDB Streams - pay per 100k reads

		* No specific prices are listed because pricing frequently differs by region and over time 
		** The RCUs and WCUs are prorated per hour. For example, if you create a table and delete it after 10 hours you only pay for the capacity of that table prorated for 10 hours. This is also how DynamoDB auto-scaling works -billing you on the hourly read and write capacity of your table. 


#### 2_3_DynamoDB Core Concepts && Provisioned Throughput :

	- DynamoDB Partition Keys:  
		• Every DynamoDB table requires a partition key 
		• The partition key of an item is also know as its hash attribute 
		• Partition key attributes must be scalar (they can only hold one value) 
		• DynamoDB uses partitions keys in an internal hash function to determine where the partition data will be stored (see partitions)

	- DynamoDB Sort Keys:  
		• DynamoDB tables do not require a sort key 
		• The sort key of an item is also know as its range attribute 
		• Range key attributes must be scalar (they can only hold one value) 
		• After DynamoDB uses the partition key to determine the partition data will be stored in (see partitions) the sort key is used to sort the data inside of that partition
