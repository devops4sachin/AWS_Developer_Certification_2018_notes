#### 1_CloudWatch Essentials:  
	• CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS services, such as EC2, ELB and S3 
	• You monitor you environment by configuring and viewing CloudWatch metrics 
	• Metrics are specific to each AWS service or resource, and include such metrics as: 
		• EC2 per-instance metrics: 
			• CPuutitization 
			• CPUCreditUsage 
		• S3 Metrics: 
			• Number0fObjects 
			• BucketSizeBytes 
		• ELB Metrics: 
			• RequestCount 
			• UnhealthyHostCount 

	• Detailed vs. Basic level monitoring: 
		• Basic: Data is available automatically in 5-minute periods at no charge 
		• Detailed: Data is available in 1-minute periods
		
	• CloudWatch Alarms can be created to trigger alerts (or other actions in your AWS accounts, such as an SNS topic), based on threshold you set on CloudWatch metrics 
	• Auto Scaling heavily utilizes CloudWatch by relying on thresholds and alarms to trigger the addition (or removal) of instances from an auto scaling group
